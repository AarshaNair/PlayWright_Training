Synopsis for Playwright Login Page Test Suite

Test Coverage:

1.Login Form Visibility:
Verifies that the login page renders correctly, ensuring the presence of the username input, password input, and the login button.

2.Successful Login:
Simulates entering valid credentials (admin / password123) and submits the form, expecting to see a success message confirming login.

3.Failed Login:
Tests the login form’s response to invalid credentials, checking that the error message “Invalid credentials” is displayed.

4.Form Submission Without Input:
Attempts to submit the form without entering any data to verify that no success or error message appears, ensuring proper client-side 
validation by the browser's required fields.

Purpose:
To ensure that the login page’s user interface elements are present and that the login functionality behaves as expected for valid and 
invalid inputs, providing appropriate feedback messages.
